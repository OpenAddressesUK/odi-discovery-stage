# About

The [Postcode Address File](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcode_Address_File) is a database which contains all known addresses in the UK. It's a potential goldmine for startups, civic hackers and just developers keen to wrangle with public data.

Unfortunately, despite the great strides the UK has made with open data, this data is still under lock and key, and with the impending [privatisation of the Post Office](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23253370), looks to remain that way.

However, all is not lost. There's is a wealth of data out there that is open that contains addresses. This project aims to gather all these addresses and provide a free, open database for startups and developers to use. 

To see the data we use, see our [sources section](/sources)

Using this data, we should get roughly 17 million+ addresses, which, while is still 10 million short of the total addresses in the UK, it's a start.
